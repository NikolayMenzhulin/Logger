The small library for logging which supports different priorities and strategies.

## Usage

Logger works with strategies that must be extends from [LoggerStrategy](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Logger/blob/main/library/src/main/java/com/github/nikolaymenzhulin/logger/strategies/strategy/base/LoggerStrategy.kt) interface. The library already provides the two realisations: [TimberLoggerStrategy](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Logger/blob/main/library/src/main/java/com/github/nikolaymenzhulin/logger/strategies/strategy/TimberLoggerStrategy.kt) based on [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) and [TestLoggerStrategy](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Logger/blob/main/library/src/main/java/com/github/nikolaymenzhulin/logger/strategies/strategy/TestLoggerStrategy.kt) orientired on using in tests. In addition to these, you can implement your own. By default Logger uses TimberLoggerStrategy.  

Use the following example of code to add strategies:
```kotlin
Logger.strategies.add(TimberLoggerStrategy())

// or

val strategies = listOf(TimberLoggerStrategy(), SomeOtherLoggerStrategy())
Logger.strategies.addAll(strategies)
```
`Logger.strategies` is actually a MutableList, so when you working with it you can use all the same methods the regular MutableList has.  

The code for adding strategies is better placed in the application class of your app.  
When you try using Logger without strategies it will be throw IllegalStateException.

After adding strategies use the following example of code to log something what you need:
```kotlin
// Logging uses TimberLoggerStrategy.

Logger.d("Hello world!") // Print "Hello World!" to DEBUG channel of Logcat.

Logger.e(Exception("Error message")) // Print the exception with the message "Error message" and the stacktrace to ERROR channel of Logcat.

Logger.i("Info with args: arg1=%s, arg2=%s", 1, 2) // Print "Info with args: arg1=1, arg2=2" to INFO channel of Logcat.

// etc.
```
